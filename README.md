# Challenges Journey

This is a repository where I will track my progress in learning Python and JavaScript by taking challenges.

## Goals

The goals of this journey are to:

* Improve my skills in Python and JavaScript
* Learn new concepts and techniques in both languages
* Build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills

## Challenges

I will be taking challenges from a variety of sources, including:

* Online coding platforms like HackerRank and CodeChef
* Coding books and tutorials
* Personal projects I come up with

## Tracking Progress

I will be tracking my progress by keeping a log of the challenges I complete. I will also be noting any new concepts or techniques I learn.

## Projects

I will be building a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills in Python and JavaScript. These projects will be of varying difficulty and will focus on different aspects of the languages.

I am excited to start this journey and I am confident that I will learn a lot along the way.

## Status

Here is my current status on the challenges:

* Python: I have completed 50 challenges.
* JavaScript: I have completed 50 challenges.

## Plans

I plan to complete at least 150 challenges in each language by the end of the year. I will also be starting to work on personal projects in both languages.

I will be updating this README file regularly to track my progress and share my learnings.

I hope you follow me on this journey!
